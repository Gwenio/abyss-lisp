# Abyss Lisp

## Description

A prototype of a Lisp dialect.

*Very much a work in progress at this time.*

It is primarily based on [Kernel](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html).

The goal for Abyss Lisp is an interpreted language as a compiler.
The plan is to include what is effectively the internals of a compiler in the built ins.
And provide abstractions on top of the built ins to convinently write code to be compiled.
